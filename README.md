# 🖥️ CS Sandbox

Welcome to **CS Sandbox** — a collection of computer science projects, experiments, and learning exercises written in Python.  
This repository is my playground for exploring algorithms, cryptography, and small-scale systems.

## 📂 Current Projects

- **inventory_system.py**  
  A simple inventory management program with a built-in shopping cart system.  
  - Add, remove, and update stock.  
  - Manage a shopping cart.  
  - Calculate totals.  

- **caesar_cipher.py**  
  Implements the Caesar cipher encryption and decryption technique.  
  - Shift letters by a given key.  
  - Encode and decode messages.
- **hangman.py**  
  a simple game of guessing words

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/cs-sandbox.git
cd cs-sandbox

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python 3.x

Libraries: Standard Python libraries (no external dependencies)

🧭 Roadmap

Planned additions include:

Sorting algorithms (Bubble, Merge, Quick sort)

Search algorithms (Linear, Binary search)

Other classic ciphers (Vigenère, Substitution, RSA toy model)

Basic data structures (Stack, Queue, Linked List)

File-based persistence for the inventory system

🤝 Contributing

This is a personal learning space, but feedback and suggestions are always welcome.

✨ Notes

This repository is continuously updated as I explore new computer science concepts and implement them in Python.
